# FormulaGo
This is a simple Golang command line application to display Formula 1 results. I am doing this to learn the language first and foremost. I plan to use the [Ergast Motor Racing Developer API](https://ergast.com/mrd/) to source the data and the [gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui) for the UI.
